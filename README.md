# Basketball game- Ken Dong & Kenneth Domine

* Created a game which a user is able to login, draft their team, and run through a simulation with their starting line up against an opponent. The goal of the project was to create an application with the following core requirements
-Express API Build an Express Application that has both HTML and JSON endpoints.
-RESTful Routes Design your CRUD routes using the REST convention.
-AJAX Leverage AJAX to fetch JSON data from the backend.
-jQuery Use jQuery to add interactivity and render data on the client-side.
-Templating Render the JSON data on the frontend using handlebars templates.
-MongoDB Persist at least two models to a Mongo Database. Use at least one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between models. You can choose to reference or embed your data.
-Git 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed. (And don't expose any secret keys/tokens on GitHub!)
-Code Style Write professional-looking code. Follow the Airbnb Javascript Styleguide.
-Visual Design Use Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy. First impressions matter!
-Heroku Deploy your app to Heroku.



## Technologies Used

* We used a combination of AJAX and FETCH to grab an API from a sports statistics websites. We then used these statistics in order to create our player profiles on the front end with Jquery. Used some CRUD routes. Used passport for user authentication Used Bootstrap for CSS.

## Existing Features

* Game has a login authentication
* Store user information into data-base
* Player stats get updated via API
* Can play game against computer generated line up

## Planned Features

* Multi-player
* Ability to change and manage line ups
